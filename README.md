This is my first project in which I was able to use the swift language to make a simple app to display data on the screen.
One of the main foucses to create this was also to help reinforce my understanding of the MVC and how to move data between the
model and view. Writing in swift has made me realize that it is very similar to the way ruby code is written. I have also reinforced
my OOPs concepts by coding this app. One example would be creating a subclass called Custom View which inherited the class UIView and 
allowed me to override the method of awakeFromNib while still keeping everything else from the parent class. I had fun doing this simple
little project and will continue to improve on my OOPs concepts as well as practicing more with Swift and app creation.
